## Reflection Document

### HTML
The exercises are simple and a good way to reinforce my knowledge on HTML, it was challenging enough so that I need to search Google for extra information but I did not need the solution video.

### Accessibility
This was a good exercise to be mindful about accessibilities when working with websites for various users with different needs. It was straightforward and the slides helped me completing the exercise.

### CSS
This was a good CSS intro exercies to poke around and explore what CSS does. No solution video needed. It was a plethora of work which is really needed to get started with CSS.

### Flexbox
This is one of my favorite exercise, I do struggle to start but I manage to figure out the rest of the exercise on my own and have fun experimenting it. I also watched the video to verify my solution and there was minor differences.

### CSS Grid
With a combination of reviewing slides and watching videos, I was able to complete this exercises and grasp the idea of what CSS Grid does, the exercise is perfect the way it is but I am just wondering if there are more ways to create a more complex design using grid.

### Bootstrap
I struggle the most this exercise and I would not complete it without the videos instructions. It was not because the exercises were complicated, it is just new things that I never touched before and part of the learning curve.

### Javascript
Overall, I did most of the exercises on my own because the syntax of Javascript is fairly similar to the programming languages that I have been working with. For `functional` exercise specifically, I struggle to get used to how to use reduce. Learning Javascript is an essential part to work with web development so I am totally happy with detailed exercises.

### JQuery
I am able to finish 01 exercise using the slide of references and watch the videos for syntax
and hints for 02 exercise. Those exercises are very helpful and a good intro to how useful and powerful
JQuery is.
